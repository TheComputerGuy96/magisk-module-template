# Unofficial Magisk Module Template

For more information about modules and repos, please check the [official documentations](https://github.com/topjohnwu/Magisk/blob/master/docs/module_repo.md)

Note: They don't point to my repositories (instead, they point to the topjohnwu's ones)

Caution: Please don't upload modules to the Magisk module repo using this template (until Magisk v15.0 gets released to the stable channel)

### README.md

This `README.md` can be shown in Magisk Manager. Place any information/changelog/notes you like.

**Please update `README.md` if you want to submit your module to the online repo!**

You can edit your `README.md` within Github's online editor, it also has an preview button! Check the [Markdown Cheat Sheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) for markdown syntaxes, it's super easy!
